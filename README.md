# Cartoonification-of-Image using-K-means-and-SVD
Our goal is to convert ordinary images into captivating cartoons, and to achieve this, we plan to develop a Python application utilizing OpenCV. The application will employ machine learning algorithms, specifically K-means Clustering and Singular Value Decomposition, in conjunction with a Bilateral Filter.
